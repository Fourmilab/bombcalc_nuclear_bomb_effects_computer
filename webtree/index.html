<h2>Strangelove Showdown</h2>

<p>
Back when I was in college in the 1960s, there was no better way for
a larval engineer or scientist to stand out from those pursuing more
mushy majors than swaggering around with a fancy slide rule in a
spiffy leather holster dangling from his belt.  &ldquo;Well now mister
phil-oss-a-pher, I don't rightly cotton to your kind of fuzzy
thinkin'. How about we settle this, just you and me&mdash;logarithms at
ten paces.&rdquo;   Then there were the peaceniks&hellip;. 
Now, I'm for peace as much as the next fellow, but it's always seemed
to me a clear lesson of history that unilateral disarmament in
the face of aggressive tyranny is not the way to peace.  Maybe it's
one of those slippery concepts which an understanding of feedback
systems and differential equations helps one to grasp more firmly
than an encyclopedic knowledge of the works of nineteenth century
political theorists.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, when some champion of human liberty in a Che Guevara T-shirt
and Mao jacket was haranguing his audience with claims like &ldquo;A single
Hiroshima bomb set off downtown would annihilate this university and
all of us in the blink of an eye&rdquo;, what better way to burnish
one's Strangelovian credentials than to whip out a handy-dandy nuclear
bomb computer slide rule, whip&mdash;slip&mdash;slide, and interrupt,
&ldquo;Naaah&hellip;fifteen kilotons at five miles? 
Surface burst?  Why, that's only a quarter to a third of a pound per
square inch overpressure&mdash;it'll probably break some window glass but
that's about it.&rdquo;  Flipping the slide rule over, &ldquo;The flash isn't
even enough to cause sunburn, and the immediate radiation is next to
nothing.&rdquo;  For some unfathomable reason, this never seemed to either
carry the argument or suitably impress chicks.
</p>

<h2>Collectible Computer</h2>

<p>
Back in those psychedelic days of yore, you could order your own
fantastic pastel plastic nuclear bomb effects computer directly  from
the U.S. Government Printing Office for a single green dollar, and
for three dollars more, obtain the authoritative 730 page book,
<cite>The Effects of Nuclear Weapons</cite>, upon which it was
based.  With the winding down of the nuclear arms race and eventual
end of the Cold War, interest in the actual consequences of setting
off nuclear weapons waned.  The book and computer were last updated
in 1977, and subsequently went out of print.  By the 1990s they had
become something of a collectors' item, with mint copies of the book
and computer selling for hundreds of dollars, although bargains
remained available if you were patient and looking for a copy to
read, not store away in the hope of eventually reselling it to a
greater fool.
</p>

<p>
Since these were publications of the U.S. federal government, which
does not assert copyright on its documents, they have been in the
public domain since inception, but interest to date has not motivated
anybody to republish them.  Fortunately, a copy of the 1977 third
edition of the book has been scanned and is now
<a href="/etexts/www/effects/" target="Fourmilab_Bombcalc_Effects">available
online</a>.
The existence of this Web resource (in PDF files for each chapter,
which can be printed if a paper copy is required), seems to have
restored some sanity to the prices quoted for used copies of the
original books, but that still leaves the bomb effects slide rule a
difficult item to obtain.
</p>

<h2>Internet Implementation</h2>

<p>
My nostalgia for this particular relic of the Cold War was such that
I've had a project to produce an online edition on my to-do list for
more than five years. Like many items on this embarrassingly long and
all too infrequently shortened list of unrealised ambitions, it's
something I half expected someone else to do long before I got to it.
This would be perfectly fine with me&mdash;I undertake these projects
because I want to see them done, and crossing off an item without the
wear and tear of doing it myself couldn't make me happier.  In fact,
scanning (and possibly OCR-ing) <cite>The Effects of Nuclear
Weapons</cite> was an item on my list before the fine folks at
Princeton got the job done.
</p>

<p>
I originally envisioned an online interactive calculator,
along the lines of a spreadsheet, either in JavaScript or, to
be really super-cool, as a server based CGI application written entirely
in Ada (doubly appropriate, not just as a programming language associated
with military applications, but because the
<a href="/babbage/sketch.html#NoteA" target="_blank">Lady</a> after which it is named
also shares a name with the creators of the bomb calculator: the
Lovelace Foundation&mdash;better known for devising the diabolical medical torture
tests for the Project Mercury astronauts chronicled by Tom Wolfe in
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553381350?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">The Right Stuff</a></cite>).
I've used this model for various other Web resources, for example
the <a href="/">Fourmilab</a>
<cite><a href="/documents/calendar/" target="_blank">Calendar Converter</a></cite>,
but every time I looked into the details, I found that the fit
between the bomb effects slide rule and a cell-and-number based
calculator was rather poor.  As users of slide rules and nomograms
(which excludes almost everybody under the age of forty) will appreciate,
once you've &ldquo;set up&rdquo; the inputs to a calculation, a
whole range of solutions can often be obtained for varying inputs just by
reading numbers which line up along a scale.  Further, it's usually
possible to work backwards from a result to discover
families of inputs which produce it.  The bomb computer takes superb
advantage of both of these characteristics.  For example, when you're
computing the
<a href="instructions.html#fallout"
   target="Fourmilab_Bombcalc_Instructions">decay of fallout</a>
from a detonation, setting up the dose rate at a single time permits
the relative dose for any time between 12 minutes and 30 days after
the burst to be read directly from the scale, or inverse
questions answered like how long one must wait before the radiation
declines to a specified level.  Or, suppose you're interested in the
tradeoff between yield and accuracy to attack a buried,
steel-reinforced bunker which requires an overpressure of 100 pounds
per square inch (PSI) to bust.
<a href="instructions.html#blastparams"
   target="Fourmilab_Bombcalc_Instructions">Setting
the overpressure scale</a> of the bomb computer to 100 PSI (opting
here for an optimum height as opposed to a
surface burst), one finds that with the roughly 100 metre accuracy of
state of the art intercontinental missiles, a bomb on the order of
one kiloton will do the deed, but with the &ldquo;general vicinity&rdquo;
accuracy available with early ballistic missiles like the Atlas (2000
foot / 600 metre circular error probable), a yield in excess of 100
kilotons, almost five times that of the Nagasaki bomb, would be
required.  Working numbers like these brings home the extent to which
technological progress in metre-accuracy precision guided munitions,
not the efforts of disarmament activists, have rendered nuclear
weapons, as the man said (albeit in a different context) &ldquo;impotent and
obsolete&rdquo;.
</p>

<p> Reflecting on the design advantages of the original calculator, I
ended up concluding the best way to bring it to the Web would be in
its original form&mdash;an interactive graphical reincarnation of the
original plastic slide rule.  Many were the obstacles, due in part to
the fact that I have only a single prototype and would never destroy
the authenticity of such an artefact by disassembling it.  I will
spare you the technical details&mdash;the result is now yours to explore.
(If you're really interested in how this Web application was built,
please see the <a href="production.html"
target="Fourmilab_Bombcalc_Instructions">production notes</a>. Basing
the online edition on the graphics of the original slide rule also
made it easy to provide what's needed for those interested to <a
href="brico.html" target="Fourmilab_Bombcalc_Instructions">build
their own replica slide rule</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Detonation Definition</h2>

<p>
Enter yield and range for complete weapon effects, or
time since detonation and relative dose rate for a fallout
computation, into the forms below, click the &ldquo;Calculate&rdquo; button, and you'll
see the results on the bomb effects computer
set to the specified values. (The two kinds of calculations
have nothing to do with one another and simply happen to share the
same slide rule; hence, they are requested on separate forms below). 
To understand the results, refer to the
<a href="instructions.html" target="Fourmilab_Bombcalc_Instructions">bomb computer instructions</a>,
which are transcribed from the sheet which accompanied the slide
rule, with illustrations added to show how values are read from the
various scales.  You can change the size of the calculator
image by entering the desired size (up to a limit of 1575
pixels&mdash;that's all the resolution there is in the scan and, for that
matter, detail on the plastic slide rule), and rotate the slide rule
image either by entering an angle or clicking on the portion of the
image you wish to appear at the top.

<h2>Why the 1962 Edition?</h2>

<p>
This interactive Web-based implementation of the quintessential Cold War
weaponeer's <em lang="la">vade mecum</em> is based on the 1962
revised edition.  Since I can already hear the vintage whiners and hate
kiddies spooling up through the octaves and decibels to decry
this choice over the most recent 1977 third edition (as far as I know,
there were no editions between these two), please permit me to
explain.  First and foremost, the 1962 slide rule is <em>the one I
have</em>, and however spiffy I considered this project to be, I
wasn't about to spend a wad of money and a lot of time chasing down
the newer edition (which, to be equally authentic, would have to come
with the matching version of the accompanying
<a href="instructions.html"
   target="Fourmilab_Bombcalc_Instructions">instructions</a>,
which, as
a single folded sheet of paper, is easily lost and missing from
many copies offered for sale.)  But also, this is an
artefact of the Cold War, and 1962 is the very heart of that epoch.
Herman Kahn's
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0313200602?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">On Thermonuclear War</a></cite>
was published in 1960, and his
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006AXSF8?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">Thinking about the Unthinkable</a></cite>
hit the shelves in 1962.  On the fiction front, the novel
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007HJGH4?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">Red Alert</a></cite> came out in 1958,
followed by
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/088001654X?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">Fail-Safe</a></cite> in 1962,
with the films they inspired,
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000055Y0X?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</a></cite> and
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004XPPE?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">Fail-Safe</a></cite>
both debuting in 1964.
In the real world, in late 1961, the Soviet Union exploded the most powerful
nuclear weapon ever developed, a 50 megaton three stage thermonuclear device
capable of 100 megatons (with vastly more fallout) were its lead tampers
replaced by uranium.  The United States responded to the resumption of Soviet
atmospheric testing with its own test series both in Nevada and the Pacific
(including the Operation Fishbowl
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004XMTE?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">nukes in space</a>),
which continued throughout 1962.  In February 1960, France exploded its first
nuclear bomb and continued testing in Algeria through 1966, and China got
into the game with its first detonation at Lop Nor in October 1964.
The British deployed their first strategic nuclear missile, the megaton class air-to-surface
Blue Steel, in December 1962.
And in October 1962, the world came as close to the brink as it ever
has during the eyeball-to-eyeball
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393317900?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    target="Amazon_Fourmilab">Cuban missile crisis</a>, while
Civil Defence pamphlets encouraged U.S. homeowners to turn a corner of their
basement into a family fallout shelter.
</p>

<p>
Yes, 1962 was the very high point of the High Cold War, so it's
entirely fitting and proper that this twenty-first century
re-creation be based on a relic dating from that year, not 1977,
which cannot help but summon images of the effete and pusillanimous
Carter administration, absurd MX peekaboo racetrack deployment
schemes, and the nascent nuclear freeze movement in the U.S.
